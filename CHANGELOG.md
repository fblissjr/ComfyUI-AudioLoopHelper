## [Unreleased]

### Added
- LatentContextExtract node: extracts tail latent frames + strips noise_mask
- LatentOverlapTrim node: trims overlap latent frames + strips noise_mask
- StripLatentNoiseMask node: low-level utility for noise_mask removal
- ScheduleToMultiPrompt node: converts TimestampPromptSchedule to MultiPromptProvider format
- overlap_latent_frames output on AudioLoopController
- Latent workflow variant (`audio-loop-music-video_latent.json`) -- UNTESTED
- Pipeline flow documentation for both workflow variants (`docs/pipeline_flow_*.md`)
- Workflow validator agent supporting both image and latent workflows
- `scripts/workflow_utils.py` and `scripts/test_workflow_integrity.py` (moved from
  internal/scripts/ for open-source distribution)
- CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- Renamed workflows: removed date-based versioning (v0408/v0409), now
  `audio-loop-music-video_image.json` and `audio-loop-music-video_latent.json`
- AudioLoopController now outputs 7 values (added overlap_latent_frames)
- overlap_latent_frames uses correct formula: `(pixel-1)//8+1` not `pixel//8`
- LatentOverlapTrim clamps overlap to prevent empty tensor edge case

### Fixed
- Latent workflow: overlap_latent_frames now dynamically wired from
  AudioLoopController through subgraph to LatentContextExtract and
  LatentOverlapTrim (was hardcoded to 4)
- Latent workflow: subgraph input 14 now receives latent-space frames
  (from slot 6) instead of pixel-space frames (from slot 5)
- AudioLoopController overlap_latent_frames tooltip: references correct
  downstream nodes instead of stale LTXVSelectLatents
